# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Mock Service Worker (MSW) for frontend testing in the Maid4Maid application. MSW will provide API mocking capabilities to enable comprehensive frontend testing without relying on the backend API, which is particularly important as the backend transitions from REST to GraphQL. This implementation will establish a robust testing foundation that can adapt to future API changes while maintaining test reliability and developer productivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to set up MSW in the project, so that I can mock API responses during testing without depending on the backend service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MSW is installed THEN the project SHALL include MSW as a development dependency
2. WHEN the project is built THEN MSW SHALL NOT be included in production bundles
3. WHEN MSW is configured THEN it SHALL support both browser and Node.js environments for different testing scenarios
4. WHEN MSW is initialized THEN it SHALL intercept HTTP requests made by the application during testing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper folder structure for MSW mocks, so that API mocks are organized and maintainable across different domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MSW folder structure is created THEN it SHALL organize mocks by domain (auth, clients, users, teams, jobs, addresses, organizations, roles)
2. WHEN mock files are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN handlers are organized THEN they SHALL be modular and easily importable
4. WHEN the structure is established THEN it SHALL support both individual handler imports and combined handler collections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API mocks for all existing services, so that frontend tests can run independently of the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication mocks are created THEN they SHALL cover login, register, password reset, and token refresh endpoints
2. WHEN client mocks are created THEN they SHALL support CRUD operations and address management
3. WHEN user mocks are created THEN they SHALL handle user management with role-based responses
4. WHEN team mocks are created THEN they SHALL support team operations and member assignments
5. WHEN job mocks are created THEN they SHALL provide scheduling and calendar-related responses
6. WHEN organization mocks are created THEN they SHALL support multi-tenant data isolation
7. WHEN role mocks are created THEN they SHALL provide role-based permission responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MSW to integrate seamlessly with the existing testing setup, so that tests can use mocked APIs without configuration overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN MSW SHALL automatically start and provide mocked responses
2. WHEN Vitest is used THEN MSW SHALL integrate with the test environment setup
3. WHEN tests complete THEN MSW SHALL clean up handlers and reset state
4. WHEN different test files run THEN they SHALL be able to use different mock configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want realistic mock data that matches the application's data models, so that tests accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mock responses are generated THEN they SHALL match TypeScript interfaces defined in schemas
2. WHEN mock data is created THEN it SHALL include realistic values for all required fields
3. WHEN relationships exist between entities THEN mock data SHALL maintain referential integrity
4. WHEN multi-language support is needed THEN mocks SHALL provide localized responses
5. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN mocks SHALL provide appropriate error responses with correct status codes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to customize mock responses per test, so that I can test specific scenarios and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test needs specific data THEN it SHALL be able to override default mock responses
2. WHEN error conditions are tested THEN mocks SHALL be configurable to return error responses
3. WHEN different user roles are tested THEN mocks SHALL provide role-specific responses
4. WHEN test isolation is needed THEN each test SHALL be able to reset mock state independently

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MSW to work in development mode, so that I can develop frontend features before backend endpoints are ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development mode is enabled THEN MSW SHALL optionally intercept API calls in the browser
2. WHEN MSW is active in development THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback about intercepted requests
3. WHEN switching between real API and mocks THEN the configuration SHALL be easily toggleable
4. WHEN development mocks are used THEN they SHALL not interfere with production builds

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that team members can effectively use and maintain the MSW setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MSW is implemented THEN documentation SHALL explain the folder structure and conventions
2. WHEN new mocks are needed THEN examples SHALL demonstrate how to create handlers for different scenarios
3. WHEN tests need custom mocks THEN documentation SHALL show how to override default handlers
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN common issues and solutions SHALL be documented
