# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the existing Maid4Maid web application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with enhanced mobile functionality for cleaning staff. The PWA will enable staff members to track their cleaning sessions in real-time, providing start/stop functionality for jobs, offline capabilities, and mobile-optimized user experience. This will improve job tracking accuracy, enable better time management, and provide real-time updates to managers and clients about cleaning progress.
