# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Job Scheduling System will refine and expand the existing Maid4Maid scheduling functionality to provide a more robust, user-friendly, and feature-complete solution for managing cleaning service appointments. The current system provides basic calendar views (month, week, agenda), job creation/editing forms, and job viewing capabilities, but lacks several critical features needed for efficient operations.

This enhancement will address current limitations including: missing recurring job support, limited mobile responsiveness, absence of conflict detection, lack of bulk operations, missing notification system, and insufficient job status management. The enhanced system will maintain compatibility with the existing multi-tenant, role-based architecture while significantly improving the user experience and operational efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

5. IF a user has insufficient permissions (not admin/manager) THEN the system SHALL disable drag functionality and show cursor-not-allowed on hover
