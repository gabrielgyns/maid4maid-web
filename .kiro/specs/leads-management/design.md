# Design Document

## Overview

The Leads Management feature will be implemented as a comprehensive CRM module within the existing Maid4Maid platform. The design follows the established patterns in the codebase, utilizing React with TypeScript, TanStack Query for data management, and shadcn/ui components for consistent UI. The feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing client management system and maintain the same role-based access control and multi-tenant architecture.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The leads management system follows the existing layered architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: React components with TypeScript
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Service Layer**: Axios-based API services with authentication
- **Data Layer**: RESTful API integration following existing patterns

### Integration Points

- **Client Management**: Direct conversion pathway from leads to clients
- **User Management**: Lead assignment to team members
- **Organization Context**: Multi-tenant data isolation
- **Authentication**: Role-based permissions for lead access
- **Notification System**: Task reminders and assignment notifications

## Data Models

### Lead Entity

```typescript
interface Lead {
  id: string;
  organizationId: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  address?: Address;
  status: LeadStatus;
  source: LeadSource;
  assignedUserId?: string;
  preferredContactMethod: ContactMethod;
  serviceInterest?: string[];
  estimatedValue?: number;
  notes?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  convertedClientId?: string;
  convertedAt?: Date;
}

enum LeadStatus {
  NEW = 'new',
  CONTACTED = 'contacted',
  QUALIFIED = 'qualified',
  PROPOSAL_SENT = 'proposal_sent',
  WON = 'won',
  LOST = 'lost',
}

enum LeadSource {
  WEBSITE = 'website',
  REFERRAL = 'referral',
  SOCIAL_MEDIA = 'social_media',
  ADVERTISEMENT = 'advertisement',
  COLD_CALL = 'cold_call',
  OTHER = 'other',
}

enum ContactMethod {
  EMAIL = 'email',
  PHONE = 'phone',
  TEXT = 'text',
  ANY = 'any',
}
```

### Lead Interaction Entity

```typescript
interface LeadInteraction {
  id: string;
  leadId: string;
  userId: string;
  type: InteractionType;
  subject?: string;
  notes: string;
  scheduledAt?: Date;
  completedAt: Date;
  createdAt: Date;
}

enum InteractionType {
  CALL = 'call',
  EMAIL = 'email',
  MEETING = 'meeting',
  TEXT = 'text',
  NOTE = 'note',
  OTHER = 'other',
}
```

### Lead Task Entity

```typescript
interface LeadTask {
  id: string;
  leadId: string;
  assignedUserId: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  dueDate: Date;
  priority: TaskPriority;
  status: TaskStatus;
  completedAt?: Date;
  completedNotes?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

enum TaskPriority {
  LOW = 'low',
  MEDIUM = 'medium',
  HIGH = 'high',
}

enum TaskStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  OVERDUE = 'overdue',
}
```

### Lead Analytics Entity

```typescript
interface LeadAnalytics {
  totalLeads: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  averageTimeToConversion: number;
  leadsByStatus: Record<LeadStatus, number>;
  leadsBySource: Record<LeadSource, number>;
  monthlyTrends: {
    month: string;
    newLeads: number;
    conversions: number;
  }[];
  teamPerformance: {
    userId: string;
    userName: string;
    assignedLeads: number;
    convertedLeads: number;
    conversionRate: number;
  }[];
}
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors

- Client-side validation using Zod schemas
- Real-time form validation feedback
- Server-side validation error display
- Graceful handling of network errors

### Business Logic Errors

- Lead assignment validation (user must be active)
- Status transition validation (prevent invalid status changes)
- Duplicate lead detection and handling
- Conversion validation (lead must be in "Won" status)

### User Experience Errors

- Loading states for all async operations
- Error boundaries for component failures
- Toast notifications for operation results
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Service layer testing with MSW mocking
- Utility function testing with Vitest
- Form validation testing with various input scenarios

### Integration Testing

- API integration testing with mock server
- User workflow testing (create → assign → convert)
- Cross-component communication testing
- State management integration testing

### End-to-End Testing

- Complete lead lifecycle testing
- Multi-user collaboration scenarios
- Permission-based access testing
- Data persistence and retrieval testing

### Test Coverage Goals

- Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- 100% coverage for business logic functions
- Comprehensive error scenario testing
- Performance testing for large lead datasets

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Implement virtual scrolling for large lead lists
- Use React Query caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement pagination for lead lists and activity timelines

### Accessibility

- ARIA labels for all interactive elements

- Audit logging for all lead modifications
- Input sanitization and XSS prevention

### Scalability

- Efficient database schema design
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Caching strategies for analytics data
