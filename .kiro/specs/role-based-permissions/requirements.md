# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Role-Based Permissions feature will implement a comprehensive permission system for the Maid4Maid frontend application. This system will integrate with the backend role model that stores permissions as JSON, enabling fine-grained access control throughout the application. The feature will ensure that users only see and can interact with functionality appropriate to their assigned role within their organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the frontend to fetch and cache user permissions on login, so that the application can make real-time authorization decisions without repeated API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL fetch the user's role and permissions from the backend
2. WHEN permissions are fetched THEN the system SHALL store them in the application state management system
3. WHEN permissions are cached THEN the system SHALL include role information, permission JSON, and organization context
4. WHEN the user's session expires THEN the system SHALL clear all cached permission data
5. WHEN permissions are updated on the backend THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to refresh cached permissions
6. WHEN permission data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL default to the most restrictive access level

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized permission checking system, so that I can consistently enforce access control throughout the application components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing permission checks THEN the system SHALL provide a usePermissions hook for React components
2. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL support checking individual permissions by key
3. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL support checking multiple permissions with AND/OR logic
4. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL return boolean values for conditional rendering
5. WHEN permission keys don't exist THEN the system SHALL default to denying access
6. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL consider organization context for scoped permissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to dynamically show or hide features based on my permissions, so that I only see functionality I'm authorized to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user lacks permission for a feature THEN the system SHALL hide the corresponding UI elements
2. WHEN navigation items require permissions THEN the system SHALL conditionally render menu items
3. WHEN buttons require permissions THEN the system SHALL conditionally render action buttons
4. WHEN pages require permissions THEN the system SHALL show appropriate access denied messages
5. WHEN forms require permissions THEN the system SHALL disable or hide restricted form fields
6. WHEN permission checks are loading THEN the system SHALL show loading states instead of content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when I attempt to access restricted functionality, so that I understand why certain actions are unavailable to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL display a clear access denied message
2. WHEN showing access denied messages THEN the system SHALL explain what permission is required
3. WHEN a user lacks permissions for a page THEN the system SHALL redirect to an appropriate alternative page
4. WHEN API calls fail due to permissions THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging purposes
6. WHEN users need elevated permissions THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to request access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a route guard, I want to protect application routes based on user permissions, so that unauthorized users cannot access restricted pages even with direct URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing route protection THEN the system SHALL create a ProtectedRoute component
2. WHEN a route requires permissions THEN the system SHALL check permissions before rendering the component
3. WHEN permission checks fail THEN the system SHALL redirect to an access denied page or login
4. WHEN permissions are loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators instead of content
5. WHEN nested routes require permissions THEN the system SHALL check permissions at each level
6. WHEN users bookmark protected URLs THEN the system SHALL handle permission checks on direct access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want different permission levels for different user roles, so that I can implement proper organizational hierarchy and access control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining permissions THEN the system SHALL support admin-level permissions for full system access
2. WHEN defining permissions THEN the system SHALL support manager-level permissions for team and client management
3. WHEN defining permissions THEN the system SHALL support staff-level permissions for job execution and basic client interaction
4. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL respect role hierarchy (admin > manager > staff)
5. WHEN system roles are involved THEN the system SHALL handle organization-independent permissions
6. WHEN custom roles are created THEN the system SHALL support organization-specific permission configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement API request authorization, so that frontend requests include proper permission context and handle authorization failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL include user role and organization context in headers
2. WHEN API requests fail with 403 status THEN the system SHALL handle unauthorized access appropriately
3. WHEN API responses indicate insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL show relevant error messages
4. WHEN token expires during API calls THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh permissions and retry
5. WHEN API calls require specific permissions THEN the system SHALL pre-validate permissions before making requests
6. WHEN permission validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent unnecessary API calls

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the permission system to work seamlessly with the existing application features, so that role-based access control integrates naturally with the current user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show only metrics and actions permitted by user role
2. WHEN managing clients THEN the system SHALL restrict client operations based on user permissions
3. WHEN scheduling jobs THEN the system SHALL limit job management capabilities according to user role
4. WHEN managing teams THEN the system SHALL control team member access based on organizational hierarchy
5. WHEN accessing user management THEN the system SHALL restrict user operations to authorized roles
6. WHEN using any existing feature THEN the system SHALL maintain current functionality while adding permission checks
