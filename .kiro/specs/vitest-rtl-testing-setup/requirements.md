# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive testing infrastructure using Vitest and React Testing Library (RTL) for the Maid4Maid application. The implementation will establish unit testing, integration testing, and component testing capabilities with coverage reporting and pre-commit hooks. This testing foundation will ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and maintain high development standards as the project scales.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Vitest as the primary testing framework, so that I can write and run fast, reliable tests for the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vitest is configured THEN it SHALL use the existing Vite configuration for optimal performance
2. WHEN tests are run THEN Vitest SHALL provide fast execution with hot module replacement
3. WHEN test files are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions (.test.ts, .spec.ts)
4. WHEN Vitest runs THEN it SHALL support TypeScript without additional compilation steps
5. WHEN tests are executed THEN Vitest SHALL provide clear output and error reporting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React Testing Library configured for component testing, so that I can test React components in a user-centric way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RTL is configured THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with Vitest
2. WHEN components are tested THEN RTL SHALL provide utilities for user interaction simulation
3. WHEN DOM queries are made THEN RTL SHALL prioritize accessibility-friendly selectors
4. WHEN component tests run THEN they SHALL render components in a realistic testing environment
5. WHEN user events are simulated THEN they SHALL behave like real user interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test utilities and setup, so that writing tests is efficient and consistent across the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test utilities are created THEN they SHALL provide common testing patterns and helpers
2. WHEN tests need providers THEN utilities SHALL offer pre-configured provider wrappers
3. WHEN mock data is needed THEN utilities SHALL integrate with the MSW implementation
4. WHEN tests require authentication THEN utilities SHALL provide authenticated user contexts
5. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN test setup SHALL automatically handle cleanup between tests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unit tests for all utility functions and services, so that core business logic is thoroughly tested and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions exist THEN they SHALL have corresponding unit tests with edge cases
2. WHEN service functions are created THEN they SHALL be tested with mocked dependencies
3. WHEN API services are tested THEN they SHALL use MSW for request/response testing
4. WHEN validation schemas are defined THEN they SHALL have comprehensive validation tests
5. WHEN error handling exists THEN it SHALL be tested with various error scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component tests for all React components, so that UI behavior and user interactions are verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components exist THEN they SHALL have tests covering rendering and props
2. WHEN user interactions are possible THEN they SHALL be tested with simulated events
3. WHEN components use hooks THEN the hook behavior SHALL be tested appropriately
4. WHEN components have conditional rendering THEN all branches SHALL be tested
5. WHEN components integrate with external services THEN they SHALL be tested with mocked services

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests for complex workflows, so that multi-component interactions and user flows are validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user workflows exist THEN they SHALL have end-to-end integration tests
2. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the complete submission flow SHALL be tested
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN routing and page transitions SHALL be tested
4. WHEN authentication flows exist THEN login/logout processes SHALL be tested
5. WHEN data flows through multiple components THEN the integration SHALL be tested

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage reporting, so that I can identify untested code and maintain quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN coverage reports SHALL be generated automatically
2. WHEN coverage is below thresholds THEN the build SHALL fail with clear messaging
3. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN they SHALL include line, branch, and function coverage
4. WHEN coverage data is collected THEN it SHALL exclude test files and configuration files
5. WHEN coverage reports are viewed THEN they SHALL provide detailed file-by-file breakdown

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks that run tests, so that broken code cannot be committed to the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN Husky SHALL automatically run relevant tests
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the commit SHALL be blocked with clear error messages
3. WHEN only specific files change THEN only related tests SHALL run for performance
4. WHEN pre-commit hooks run THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
5. WHEN hooks are bypassed THEN it SHALL require explicit developer action

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing best practices and patterns documented, so that the team can write consistent, maintainable tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing guidelines are created THEN they SHALL cover naming conventions and structure
2. WHEN test patterns are documented THEN they SHALL include examples for common scenarios
3. WHEN testing utilities are provided THEN they SHALL have clear usage documentation
4. WHEN new developers join THEN they SHALL have comprehensive testing onboarding materials
5. WHEN testing issues arise THEN troubleshooting guides SHALL be available

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance testing and optimization, so that tests run efficiently in development and CI environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run locally THEN they SHALL complete within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN tests run in CI THEN they SHALL be optimized for parallel execution
3. WHEN test performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL identify bottlenecks
4. WHEN large test suites exist THEN they SHALL support selective test execution
5. WHEN tests are slow THEN optimization strategies SHALL be documented and implemented
